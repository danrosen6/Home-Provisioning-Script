## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

Both scripts:

- Configure Git (optional)
- Install VS Code extensions for Python development
- Configure Python with proper PATH setup

## üìù Logging

The scripts create detailed logs in the same directory:
- `setup-log-[timestamp].txt`

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- If an application fails to install, try running the script again
- For PATH-related issues, restart your computer after running the script
- If Python command isn't working, try using `py` instead
- Check the log file for detailed error information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Feature Loss

These scripts remove several built-in Windows features in favor of performance, privacy, and third-party alternatives. Notable changes:

- **Built-in Apps**: Mail/Calendar, Camera, Maps, Office Hub, Xbox integration
- **Services**: Superfetch (minimal impact on SSDs), Parental Controls, Offline Files
- **Features**: Cortana, OneDrive auto-start, background app updates, activity history/timeline

On Windows 11:
- **UI Features**: Centered taskbar, new context menu, Widgets, Teams integration, Snap layouts hover

Most users find these tradeoffs worthwhile for improved performance and privacy. All changes can be manually reversed if needed.

## üîí Security Note

These scripts change your execution policy temporarily to run. It's recommended to review the script content before running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can modify the scripts to:
- Add or remove applications
- Change default selections
- Adjust Windows optimizations
- Add additional development tools

## üìÑ License

These scripts are provided as-is, free to use, modify, and distribute.
