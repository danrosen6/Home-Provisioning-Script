# Windows Post-Reset Setup Scripts

A collection of PowerShell scripts to automate the setup of fresh Windows installations. These scripts install essential software, remove bloatware, and optimize Windows settings for performance, privacy, and usability.

This repository contains two scripts:
- `windows10-setup.ps1` - For Windows 10 systems
- `windows11-setup.ps1` - For Windows 11 systems

## üöÄ Features

Both scripts provide:

- **Software Installation**: Automatically install popular and essential applications
- **Bloatware Removal**: Remove pre-installed, unnecessary Windows applications
- **System Optimization**: Configure Windows for better performance and privacy
- **Development Environment Setup**: Prepare your system for software development
- **Reliable Installation Methods**: Multiple fallback options for application installation

## üîç Choosing the Right Script

| Feature | Windows 10 Script | Windows 11 Script |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Target OS** | Windows 10 (all versions) | Windows 11 (all versions) |
| **Check OS Compatibility** | Basic | Enhanced (checks TPM and Secure Boot) |
| **UI Optimizations** | Windows 10 specific | Windows 11 specific (taskbar, context menu) |
| **Default Apps** | Core development tools + browsers | Adds Windows Terminal and PowerToys |
| **Bloatware Removal** | Windows 10 bloatware | Windows 11 bloatware (includes Teams, Widgets) |

## üìã Prerequisites

- Administrative privileges
- Internet connection
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher

## üíª Usage

1. Download the appropriate script for your Windows version
2. Right-click on PowerShell and select "Run as administrator"
3. Navigate to the script location
4. Run the script with:

```powershell
# For Windows 10
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\windows10-setup.ps1

# For Windows 11
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\windows11-setup.ps1
```

## üì¶ Applications Installed

Both scripts can install the following applications (selectable during execution):

| Application | Purpose | Default |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Google Chrome | Web browser | ‚úì |
| Spotify | Music streaming | ‚úì |
| Discord | Communication platform | ‚úì |
| Steam | Gaming platform | ‚úì |
| Git | Version control | ‚úì |
| Visual Studio Code | Code editor | ‚úì |
| Python | Programming language | ‚úì |
| PyCharm Community | Python IDE | ‚úì |
| GitHub Desktop | Git GUI | ‚úì |
| Postman | API testing tool | ‚úì |

**Windows 11 script adds:**
- Windows Terminal (modern terminal experience)
- Microsoft PowerToys (productivity toolkit)

## üß† Reliable Installation System

The scripts use a progressive installation approach to ensure reliable application setup:

1. **Standard Package Manager**: Try Chocolatey first
2. **Checksum Bypass**: If standard installation fails due to checksums, retry with `--ignore-checksums` flag
3. **Direct Download**: If package manager fails, download directly from official sources
4. **Multiple Verification Paths**: Check multiple common installation locations to verify success

This approach is particularly valuable for frequently updated applications like Spotify, Chrome, and Discord.

- Configure Git (optional)
- Install VS Code extensions for Python development
- Configure Python with proper PATH setup
- Set up dedicated APIs folder for API testing with Postman

## üìù Logging

The scripts create detailed logs in the same directory:
- `setup-log-[timestamp].txt`

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- If an application fails to install, try running the script again
- For PATH-related issues, restart your computer after running the script
- If Python command isn't working, try using `py` instead
- Check the log file for detailed error information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Feature Loss

These scripts remove several built-in Windows features in favor of performance, privacy, and third-party alternatives. Notable changes:

- **Built-in Apps**: Mail/Calendar, Camera, Maps, Office Hub, Xbox integration
- **Services**: Superfetch (minimal impact on SSDs), Parental Controls, Offline Files
- **Features**: Cortana, OneDrive auto-start, background app updates, activity history/timeline

On Windows 11:

Most users find these tradeoffs worthwhile for improved performance and privacy. All changes can be manually reversed if needed.

## üîí Security Note

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can modify the scripts to:
- Add or remove applications
